### Code modifications: 
**3/13/21**
- **Yahoo Finance Indexes**: In the code, "bs.find("script",text=re.compile("root.App.main")).text" seemed to return an empty string for some users which could be an issue with the Python or BeautifulSoup version. A fix for this was to use the *str()* function instead of *.text*.
- **New York Times vaccinations**: The html text for the class attribute seemed to have changed on the NYT website. So the text used for parsing needed to be changed accordingly. The previous code containing the older parsing method is also shown in the code but commented out.

**10/10/21**
- **Added new metrics**: Added *Shiller PE*, *Buffet indicator* and *FINRA debt margin* metrics to the dashboard as new measures of market valuation. 
- **Dashboard redesign**: Reduced the *VIX volatility indicator* data to only keep the current VIX value. This data was combined with the 3 new metrics and displayed as part of the same chart on the bottom-left. 

**11/10/21**
- **Changed source for major indexes**: Now retrieving major indexes information using the Yahoo Finance API which is increasing compute time by a few seconds. No longer scraping the information from a web source. 
- **Added *Gold* and *Bitcoin* assets**: Added Gold and Bitcoin metrics part of the *Indexes and Assets* plot. These metrics are also being extracted using the Yahoo Finance API. 
- **Changed source for interest rates**: Now retrieving long-term and short-term interest rates from *Treasury.gov* which is an official source instead of *Ycharts*. 
- **Monthly data for interest rates**: Interest rates plot x-axis now covers the current month. 

**11/18/21**
- **Added Streamlit functionality**: Created Python scripts to generate the dashboard using Streamlit. The dashboard can now be viewed on a browser as an App. The code is located in the *Dashboard_With_Streamlit_App* folder. The *requirements.txt* file is also included there. 

**12/21/21**
- **Updated code for parsing vaccination data**: Modified text indicators for vaccination statistics as they had changed on the source website. 

**1/20/22**
- **Replaced Yahoo Finance API with Rapid API**: Now extracting indexes/indicators and VIX values using Rapid API which works on top of the Yahoo Finance API but transactions are executed much quicker. **Note: You will need to sign up to Rapid API to generate your own API key which can be inserted into the 'extract_stock_info' function in the 'helper_functions.py' module. The free option allows 500 transactions per month.**

**2/3/22**
- **Added booster shot data**: Added booster shot information part of the vaccination section. Removed total shots delivered information. 

**3/5/22**
- **Updated treasury rates URL**: Added a new URL for extracting the treasury rates as the web data was moved to a new location. Made some minor changes to the code to adjust to the new XML format for the rates table. 

**7/1/22**
- **Added new API for extracting stock/index info**: Replaced the older Rapid API with a new *YahooFinance Stocks* API. Users will need to create their own personal API Key in order to use the API functionality within this code. The key for the API can be created on the Rapid API website. 
- **Reduced the code for extracting indexes**: Converted the code into a function which is placed inside the helper function.
